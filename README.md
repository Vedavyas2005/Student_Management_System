# Student_Management_System

A modern Student Management System built entirely in Python using Tkinter â€” but with a twist. Instead of the classic, old-school Tkinter look, we used CustomTkinter, an extended version of Tkinter that brings in modern UI components, theme toggling (light/dark), and a cleaner design.

This project was designed to be:

Modular & Scalable â†’ follows a clean folder structure with separate modules for students, faculty, admins, and fees.

Role-Based â†’ supports SuperAdmin, Admin, Faculty, and Student logins, each with their own dashboards and permissions.

Feature-Rich â†’ from attendance and grades to fees with live pending-balance calculations.

Database-Driven â†’ backed by SQLite with proper relational design.

User-Friendly â†’ clean UI, theme toggle, CSV exports, and dynamic summaries for fees.

In short: classic Tkinter power with modern CustomTkinter looks ðŸš€
